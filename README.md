# Python-Trigonometric-Functions

This is my work for our trigonometric functions summative. ICS3U

I used this website for my work and copied the np.linespace work and np.cos and np.sine from it. These functions are for setting the format for the graph and calculating the cos, sine and tan into the graph.

I used this youtube video to better understand the functions I got from the website.

Using this website I learnt how to graph tan properly and understood it.
