# Python-Trigonometric-Functions
This is my work for our trigonometric functions summative. ICS3U

I used this website for my work and copied the np.linespace work and np.cos, np.sine and np.tan from it. These functions are for setting the format for the graph and calculating the cos, sine and tan into the graph.
